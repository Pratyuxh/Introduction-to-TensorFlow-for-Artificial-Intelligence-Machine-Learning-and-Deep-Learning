Q1 What is a Convolution?
-A technique to isolate features in images

Q2 What is a Pooling?
-A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features

Q3 How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
-They isolate features in images

Q4 After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
-26x26

Q5 After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
-13x13

Q6 Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
-It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
